plone.transforms - 0.1 Unreleased

    - Initial design and work. Lots of work has been done on the Pastisprint
      in Aix-en-Provence in August 2007. Thx to atReal and Thierry Benita for
      organizing it and his whole family for hosting us.

      Special thanks to 'Focus-man' and his special powers which let us focus
      on the work ;)

      Also thanks to Google for its Summer of Code project which sponsored
      hannosch for his work.

      Kudos to Benjamin Saller, Sidnei da Silva and Sylvain Th√©nault for the
      PortalTransforms product which this work has been heavily based upon.
