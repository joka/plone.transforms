plone.transforms - 0.1 Unreleased

    - Initial design and work. Lots of work has been done on the Pastisprint
      in Aix-en-Provence in August 2007. Thx to atReal and tbenita for
      organizing it and his whole family for hosting us.
      
      Also thanks to Google for its Summer of Code project which sponsored
      hannosch for his work.

      Special kudos to Benjamin Saller, Sidnei da Silva and Sylvain Th√©nault
      for the PortalTransforms product which this work has been heavily based
      upon.
