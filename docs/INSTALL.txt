plone.transforms Installation
=============================

manual configuration
--------------------

 * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
   ``easy_install plone.transforms``. Find out how to install setuptools
   (and EasyInstall) here:
   http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

 * Create a file called ``plone.transforms-configure.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="plone.transforms" />

 * Create a file called ``plone.transforms-meta.zcml`` in the
   ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
   should only contain this::

       <include package="plone.transforms"/>

configuration with zc.buildout
------------------------------

in your buildout add to your instance-part zcml assignment::

  eggs = 
      ...
      plone.transforms 

  zcml =
      ... 
      plone.transforms-meta
      plone.transforms
